Hi welcome All,
This Project contains Inferencing a onnx/Openvino model using Openvino 2023 and Opencv Runtime in c++ .
The code is written for a segmentation model inference , Source code needs to be re-written for Other Model inference 

Folder Structure 

1.Extra 
  1.1 Output_Mask  --> Output mask generated by the model 
  1.2 input  --> Input image (image can be of any dimension)
  1.3 Final_Resized_mask  --> Post processed Output_Mask
  1.4 Dependency
      1.4.1 Models  --> Contains ONNX models and openvino Optimized models (.bin and .xml )

2. Generate IR files from Openvino  --> has mo.exe which helps in converting the onnx model to Openvino Optimized models 
                                   --> It has its own Readme file, explaining how to run to get the models 

3. Opencv --> Includes opencv dependencies like header files (.h) , Libary files (.lib) and Dll (.dll ) files
         --> It uses Different .lib and .dll for Debug and release Build 

4. Runtime --> Openvino Runtime dependencies like header files (.h) , Libary files (.lib) and Dll (.dll ) files
          --> It uses Different .lib and .dll for Debug and release Build 
5.x64  --> Pre build debug and Release folder containing .exe and .dll dependencies 

.bat files --> we need to move the "Extra" folder into .\x64\release (or).\x64\Debug during Build (since .exe reads and uses this folder)
           --> This .bat files are attached in Project settings (project properties -> Configuration Properties ->Build Events ->Post-Build Event)
           --> By attaching the .bat files in VCxProj we can execute the the scripts easily
